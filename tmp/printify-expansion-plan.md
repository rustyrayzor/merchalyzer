## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Product Management (Week 1-2)
1. **Product Viewing** ✅ (Starting now)
2. **Product Creation** (After product viewing)
3. **Basic Workflow Sync** (After product creation)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)
4. **Inventory Management**
5. **Order Management**
6. **Enhanced Workflow Integration**

## Technical Considerations

### API Rate Limiting
- Printify API has rate limits (600 requests/hour)
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### Data Synchronization
- Handle concurrent modifications
- Implement optimistic updates
- Add conflict resolution for inventory changes

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for product images
- Pagination for large product lists
- Caching strategies for API responses

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- Offline capability considerations

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- ✅ All stores load successfully
- ⏳ Products display correctly with images and variants
- ⏳ New products can be created from processed images
- ⏳ Inventory levels update in real-time
- ⏳ Orders are tracked and managed

### Performance Metrics
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- API response times < 1 second
- Support for 1000+ products per store
- Smooth scrolling with large product lists

### User Experience Metrics

- Accessible interface following WCAG guidelines

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Printify may change their API
  - *Mitigation*: Version pinning, comprehensive tests
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls may be throttled
  - *Mitigation*: Caching, batch operations, user notifications
- **Large Data Sets**: Performance issues with many products
  - *Mitigation*: Pagination, virtualization, optimized queries

### Business Risks
- **Data Loss**: Product data may be corrupted
  - *Mitigation*: Regular backups, validation, rollback capabilities
- **Integration Complexity**: Complex workflow may confuse users
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, clear documentation, user testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- API client functionality
- Component rendering
- Form validation
- Error handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end product creation workflow
- API error scenarios
- Data synchronization
- Performance under load

### User Acceptance Testing
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance validation
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start implementing product viewing functionality
2. **Short-term**: Complete product creation workflow
3. **Medium-term**: Implement workflow synchronization
4. **Long-term**: Add inventory and order management
